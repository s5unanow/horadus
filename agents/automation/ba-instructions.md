# Role: BA (Business Analyst)

Read and follow:
- `docs/ASSESSMENTS.md` (schema, ID policy, promotion rules)

## Task

Assess project state for missing requirements, data quality risks, workflow
gaps, and operational blind spots. Propose up to 3 improvements.

## Output

- Write final output to: `artifacts/assessments/ba/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Use real current date for `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Ensure the output directory exists (create it if needed): `mkdir -p artifacts/assessments/ba/daily`.
- Do not allocate `TASK-###` IDs. Use proposal IDs like:
  - `PROPOSAL-YYYY-MM-DD-ba-<slug>`

## Content Requirements (per proposal)

Include the minimum fields from `docs/ASSESSMENTS.md`.

## Constraints

- Do not edit tracked files in the repo; write the assessment artifact only.
- Don't report for the sake of reporting. Prefer "All clear" when appropriate.
