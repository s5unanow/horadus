## In Progress

- `TASK-070` Trend Baseline Prior Review and Sign-Off `[REQUIRES_HUMAN]` (manual baseline validation pending)
- `TASK-077` Cost-First Pipeline Ordering `[REQUIRES_HUMAN]` (manual execution/approval pending)
- `TASK-080` Telegram Collector Task Wiring `[REQUIRES_HUMAN]` (manual execution/approval pending)
- `TASK-084` Production Security Default Guardrails `[REQUIRES_HUMAN]` (manual execution/approval pending)
- `TASK-085` Require Explicit Admin Key for Key Management `[REQUIRES_HUMAN]` (manual execution/approval pending)

## Blocked

- `TASK-070`, `TASK-077`, `TASK-080`, `TASK-084`, and `TASK-085` are explicitly marked `[REQUIRES_HUMAN]` and are blocked for autonomous completion.

## Next Up (Priority Order)

1. Complete `TASK-070` baseline prior review/sign-off for active trends
2. Resolve remaining human-gated hardening tasks (`TASK-077`, `TASK-080`, `TASK-084`, `TASK-085`)
3. Execute `TASK-126` taxonomy drift guardrails (runtime gap queue + benchmark taxonomy alignment) after `TASK-066` completion

## Expert Feedback Integration ✅

Based on expert review, added 9 new tasks:

| Task | Description | Priority |
|------|-------------|----------|
| TASK-028 | Risk levels + probability bands | P1 |
| TASK-029 | Enhanced trend definitions | P2 |
| TASK-030 | Event lifecycle tracking | P1 |
| TASK-031 | Source tier and reporting type | P2 |
| TASK-032 | Trend outcomes for calibration | P1 |
| TASK-033 | Contradiction detection | P2 |
| TASK-034 | Human feedback API | P2 |
| TASK-035 | Calibration dashboard | P2 |
| TASK-036 | Cost protection & budget limits | P1 |

### Key Additions
- **Risk levels**: Low / Guarded / Elevated / High / Severe
- **Event lifecycle**: emerging → confirmed → fading → archived
- **Source tiers**: primary / wire / major / regional / aggregator
- **Calibration**: Brier scores, outcome tracking
- **Cost protection**: Kill switch for API spend
- **Trend config**: disqualifiers, falsification criteria

## Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| M1: Basic API + DB running | Week 1 | ✅ Complete |
| M2: RSS ingestion working | Week 2 | ✅ Complete |
| M3: GDELT integration | Week 3 | ✅ Complete |
| M3.5: Telegram integration | Week 3 | ✅ Complete |
| M4: LLM classification pipeline | Week 4 | ✅ Complete |
| M5: Trend engine operational | Week 5 | ✅ Complete |
| M6: Weekly reports generating | Week 6 | ✅ Complete |
| M7: Reporting APIs operational | Week 7 | ✅ Complete |
| M8: Full system operational | Week 8 | 🚧 In Progress |

## Known Issues

- Human-gated sign-off/hardening tasks (`TASK-070`, `TASK-077`, `TASK-080`, `TASK-084`, `TASK-085`) remain the main completion bottleneck, and launch stays `No-Go` until they are resolved.

## Architecture Validated ✅

Expert confirmed core design:
- ✅ Events as core unit (not articles)
- ✅ Log-odds for probability tracking
- ✅ LLM extracts signals; code computes deltas
- ✅ Two-tier LLM processing (Tier 1 → Tier 2)
- ✅ Evidence ledger with full provenance

## Recent Decisions

- Project bootstrapped with agent-friendly structure
- Using log-odds for probability tracking (ADR-003)
- Two-tier LLM processing (Tier 1 → Tier 2) (ADR-005)
- Risk levels instead of single probability numbers (expert feedback)
- Event lifecycle to reduce noise (expert feedback)
- Calibration infrastructure for long-term accuracy (expert feedback)

## Technical Debt

- None currently requiring immediate autonomous remediation.

## Notes

- MVP path: Ingest → Cluster → Score → Report (Phases 0-4)
- Calibration meaningful after 2+ months of data
- Knowledge graph deferred (PostgreSQL sufficient for MVP)
- Remember to update this file when completing milestones
