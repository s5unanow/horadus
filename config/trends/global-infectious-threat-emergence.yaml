name: "Emergence of Globally Significant Infectious Threats"
description: |
  Tracks emergence and international spread of novel or materially changed
  pathogens with system-level health and economic impact. Covers PHEIC-grade
  events and above, encompassing both natural and engineered origins.

baseline_probability: 0.12
decay_half_life_days: 45

disqualifiers:
  - signal: "pathogen_contained"
    effect: "reassess"
    description: "Verified containment with no sustained cross-border spread"
  - signal: "pathogen_eradicated_or_fully_controlled"
    effect: "reset_to_baseline"
    description: "Pathogen eradicated or controlled with verified sustained zero transmission globally for 60+ days"
  - signal: "false_alarm_reclassification"
    effect: "reassess"
    description: "Event reclassified as non-systemic threat"

falsification_criteria:
  decrease_confidence:
    - "R_t below 1 across major clusters sustained for 14+ days"
    - "No sustained transmission in multiple regions for 30+ days"
  increase_confidence:
    - "Sustained transmission across 3+ continents"
    - "Rapid increase in severe outcomes and excess mortality"
    - "Novel pathogen with pandemic-potential characteristics identified in multiple countries"
  would_invalidate_model:
    - "Fundamental change in surveillance comparability"
    - "Emergence of threat class requiring fundamentally different tracking methodology"
