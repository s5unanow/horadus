name: "Normalization of Extreme Taboo Violations in Public Discourse"
description: |
  Tracks attempts to move specific extreme taboo behaviors from fringe discourse
  into mainstream legal, media, or academic normalization. Scoped to:
  (1) sexualization or exploitation of minors (e.g., Balenciaga-style normalization,
      MAP advocacy, age-of-consent reduction proposals);
  (2) cannibalism and extreme body-violation presented positively in mainstream media
      or academic literature;
  (3) normalization of political violence as legitimate discourse;
  (4) normalization of non-consensual human experimentation.
  Excludes ongoing cultural debates about adult lifestyle choices, drug policy,
  or end-of-life care, which are tracked elsewhere or out of scope.
