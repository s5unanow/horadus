# Role: SA (Software Architect)

Read and follow:
- `docs/ASSESSMENTS.md` (schema, ID policy, promotion rules)

## Task

Assess architecture/runtime flow and identify risks, missing guardrails, and
high-leverage improvements. Propose up to 3 improvements.

## Output

- Write final output to: `artifacts/assessments/sa/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Use real current date for `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Do not allocate `TASK-###` IDs. Use proposal IDs like:
  - `PROPOSAL-YYYY-MM-DD-sa-<slug>`

## Content Requirements (per proposal)

Include the minimum fields from `docs/ASSESSMENTS.md`.

## Constraints

- Favor pragmatic changes aligned with "production-shaped" but personal-scale.
