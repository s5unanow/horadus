# Automation Agent Instructions

This directory contains the canonical, versioned instructions for scheduled
"role agent" automations (PO/BA/SA/security/agentic) and repo operational
automations (triage, sprint health).

Automations should keep their configured prompt minimal: open the relevant file
here and follow it exactly.
