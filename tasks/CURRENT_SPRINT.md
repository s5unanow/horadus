## Human Blocker Metadata

- TASK-080 | owner=human-operator | last_touched=2026-03-03 | next_action=2026-03-05 | escalate_after_days=7
- TASK-189 | owner=human-operator | last_touched=2026-03-03 | next_action=2026-03-05 | escalate_after_days=7
- TASK-190 | owner=human-operator | last_touched=2026-03-03 | next_action=2026-03-05 | escalate_after_days=7

## Telegram Launch Scope

- launch_scope: excluded_until_task_080_done
- decision_date: 2026-03-03
- rationale: Telegram ingestion remains explicitly out of launch scope until the human-gated wiring/sign-off task closes.

- `TASK-219` Add structured triage input collection command ✅
- `TASK-220` Migrate wrapper targets and agent docs to the CLI ✅
- `TASK-221` Add repo-owned Horadus CLI skill ✅
- `TASK-222` Dogfood Horadus CLI triage flow and capture follow-ups ✅
- `TASK-223` Add status filters and compact output to `horadus tasks search` ✅
- `TASK-224` Surface human-blocker urgency in task and triage outputs ✅
- `TASK-240` Keep `docs-freshness` from dropping dev dependencies ✅
- `TASK-242` Unblock Gold-Set Benchmark and Capture Quality Blockers ✅
  completion note: restored runnable benchmark preflight, generated candidate eval artifacts, did not promote a new baseline because quality remained unacceptable, and queued the follow-up fixes into the active sprint backlog.
- `TASK-243` Stabilize Tier-1 Routing Quality Under Eval and Runtime Load ✅
  completion note: changed runtime Tier-1 safe default to single-item requests, kept benchmark batch mode as explicit diagnostic mode with artifact metadata, and recorded paired realtime vs batch evidence showing batch still underperforms realtime.
- `TASK-244` Persist Per-Item Benchmark Failure Diagnostics ✅
  completion note: benchmark artifacts now persist per-item Tier-1/Tier-2 outcomes, failure category/message, best-effort raw model output, and compact success summaries for faster debugging.
- `TASK-245` Add Explicit Tier-1 Scoring Rubric and Calibration Examples ✅
  completion note: added explicit Tier-1 score bands and targeted fiction/documentary/commentary examples, added prompt regression tests, and ran a fresh gold-set benchmark before promotion.
- `TASK-246` Enrich Tier-2 Signal Payload Beyond Keyword Bags ✅
  completion note: Tier-2 payloads now include human-readable indicator descriptions plus specificity/abstention prompt guidance and regression tests, but the 10-item human-verified benchmark showed no measurable accuracy improvement so no baseline was promoted.
- `TASK-247` Evaluate GPT-5 Reasoning Models for Tier-1/Tier-2 ✅
  completion note: benchmarked cache-disabled GPT-5 candidate configs on the shared 10-item human-verified slice, found `gpt-5-nano` + `minimal` best for Tier-1 and `gpt-5-mini` + `low` best for Tier-2, and documented that Responses API migration is not required for the switch because Chat Completions already supports the needed structured-output and reasoning controls.
- `TASK-248` Evaluate `gpt-5-nano` with Minimal Reasoning for Tier-1 ✅
  completion note: reused the cache-disabled `TASK-247` artifact to close the Tier-1-specific decision; `gpt-5-nano` with `minimal` reasoning beat both `gpt-4.1-nano` and `gpt-5-nano` `low` on the shared human-verified slice, so it is the recommended Tier-1 target after runtime reasoning controls land.
- `TASK-249` Add First-Class Reasoning-Effort Controls for LLM Routes ✅
  completion note: promoted `reasoning_effort` to a first-class Tier-1/Tier-2 runtime and benchmark route setting, omitted unsupported reasoning/temperature params safely in the shared adapter, and surfaced active reasoning metadata in benchmark artifacts plus Tier-2 degraded-mode telemetry.
- `TASK-250` Make Eval Artifacts Strictly Reproducible and Traceable ✅
  completion note: benchmark and audit artifacts now record source-control provenance, prompt/config fingerprints, dataset fingerprints, and normalized invocation metadata, while the docs keep `ai/eval/results/*.json` ignored and route all committed eval artifacts through `ai/eval/baselines/`.
- `TASK-241` Fix Horadus CLI Global Flag Precedence ✅
- `TASK-215` Gate task completion on current-head PR review comments ✅
- `TASK-239` External architecture review backlog intake preservation (2026-03-06) ✅
- `TASK-253` Raise Measured Runtime Coverage to 100% with Behavior-Focused Tests ✅
  completion note: the repo now reaches `100%` measured coverage for `src/`
  in the unit coverage run (`1294 passed`) using behavior-focused tests across
  CLI, API, workers, ingestion, eval, and processing/runtime edge cases rather
  than new omit rules or snapshot padding.
- `TASK-258` Add a Canonical Horadus Task Completion Command ✅
  completion note: `horadus tasks finish` now owns the task-completion lifecycle
  end to end, `make task-finish` delegates to the CLI as a thin compatibility
  wrapper, and the legacy shell entrypoint is reduced to a compatibility shim
  rather than a second lifecycle engine.
- `TASK-260` Add a Full Local CI-Parity Gate in Horadus CLI ✅
  completion note: `horadus tasks local-gate --full` now owns the canonical
  post-task CI-parity validation path, `make local-gate` delegates to the CLI
  as a thin compatibility wrapper, and the command list now covers tracked
  artifacts, docs freshness, repo-wide lint/type/unit/security checks,
  integration, and build verification in one backpressure-friendly sequence.
- `TASK-259` Add a Mechanical Done-State Verifier and Explicit Lifecycle States ✅
  completion note: `horadus tasks lifecycle [TASK-XXX] [--strict]` now reports
  machine-checkable lifecycle state from one shared model, `--strict` defines
  repo-policy completion as `local-main-synced`, and `horadus tasks finish`
  reuses the same verifier instead of relying on separate informal success
  criteria.
- `TASK-261` Auto-Handle Docker Readiness for Workflow Gates ✅
  completion note: the canonical workflow gates now detect when Docker is
  required, attempt best-effort local auto-start on supported environments,
  fail closed with a specific blocker when the daemon still is not ready, and
  keep that behavior scoped to the explicit workflow paths rather than unrelated
  CLI commands.
- `TASK-263` Route Repo Workflow Automation Through Horadus CLI and Skill ✅
  completion note: `horadus tasks safe-start TASK-XXX --name short-name` now
  provides the canonical guarded autonomous task-start flow, `make
  agent-safe-start` is reduced to a thin compatibility wrapper, and the repo
  docs plus Horadus skill now point agents to one consistent CLI workflow
  surface.
- `TASK-264` Enforce Horadus CLI, Skill, and Docs Drift Consistency ✅
  completion note: canonical task-workflow commands now come from one shared
  source, `horadus tasks context-pack` emits that same workflow guidance, and
  the repo-owned docs freshness gate fails when AGENTS/README/runbook/Horadus
  skill surfaces drift away from the canonical CLI workflow commands or raw
  `git`/`gh` escape-hatch guidance.
- `TASK-262` Enforce No Early Completion Claims in Agent Workflow Guidance ✅
  completion note: the agent-facing docs now explicitly forbid claiming local
  milestones as completion, call local commits/tests/clean trees checkpoints
  rather than done states, require agents to continue past commit boundaries
  unless the user asked for a checkpoint, and require locally solvable blockers
  to be resolved before reporting blocked; docs freshness now enforces that
  guidance across the canonical docs.
- `TASK-265` Add Structured Horadus CLI Friction Logging ✅
  completion note: `horadus tasks record-friction` now appends structured
  gitignored JSONL entries under `artifacts/agent/horadus-cli-feedback/` for
  real Horadus workflow gaps or forced fallback only, while AGENTS/runbook/skill
  guidance explicitly keeps that log out of routine task flow and out of
  versioned source-of-truth planning records.
- `TASK-266` Add Daily Horadus Friction Summary Automation ✅
  completion note: `horadus tasks summarize-friction` now writes compact daily
  grouped reports under `artifacts/agent/horadus-cli-feedback/daily/`, the
  repo-owned automation desired state is versioned under `ops/automations/`,
  and follow-up task ideas remain human-review suggestions rather than auto-
  created backlog records.
- `TASK-275` Enforce Finish-Command Review-Gate Timeouts Without Agent Bypass ✅
  completion note: `horadus tasks finish` now requires a positive review-gate
  timeout, rejects timeout-policy bypass overrides, fails closed when the
  required current-head review never arrives, and the agent-facing workflow
  docs now treat reviewer timeout as a blocker instead of a raw `gh pr merge`
  escape hatch.
