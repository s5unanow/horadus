name: "Protein Transition from Traditional Meat to Alternatives"
description: |
  Tracks structural substitution from conventional meat consumption toward
  alternative proteins, including plant-based, cultivated meat, precision
  fermentation, and insect-based products.

falsification_criteria:
  decrease_confidence:
    - "Alternative protein share stagnates below threshold for 5+ years"
    - "No policy or procurement shift over multiple cycles"
  increase_confidence:
    - "Fast market-share growth in urban retail and public procurement"
    - "Tighter livestock regulation and subsidy shift"
